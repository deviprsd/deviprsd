I have been on a learning journey since I was handed down my first laptop. The magic of software rocked my world and I have been tinkering with various technologies, stacks, concepts and all the goodies since. The biggest decision of my life as a high school graduate was to move to America to do my Bachelors. I have had many oppurtunies to experience the world from different lenses, and it has added a lot of depth to my experiences. After spending 5 years in the US, I'm very interested in doing the same in Japan.

Professionaly, I have many years of experince from small companies to large enterprises where I had to put a lot of skills to the extreme test and improved on them. While my expertise spans the web ecosystem - HTML, CSS, JS (TS), React, I'm fluent in many other languages such as Java, Swift, Python. While having working experince in Go, C, HCL. Over the years of working in industry, having lead many projects I have developed a strong set of patterns and opinions but always have an open mind - never straying away from what matters and those are the larger concepts of System Design. 

Designing complex system is one of my biggest speciality, I love to understand all the gears, wires and pipelines put together. What makes them tick? How can I make it even more efficient? What are its domains? Engineering solutions to such problems is an absolute blast. 

Recently I have been digging a lot deeper into the Functional Paradigm coming from OOP backgrounds, I have chosen [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) to be medium of learning this paradigm as well as stack for my personal projects. Elixir has been an pleasant experience in the near future it is something I would want to pursue more professionally. 

My current efforts to contributing back to the Elixir community,
- Mostly related to [Ash Framework](https://www.ash-hq.org/) is trying to create a `DataLayer` for [EdgedDB](https://www.edgedb.com/) - [ash_edgedb](https://github.com/deviprsd/ash_edgedb)
- Creating new ideas also is contributing back üòé, they are located at a different organization where I try to work it with my friends. They are private but you can request access for visibilty by reaching out to me at deviprsd21@gmail.com - [Creative Destruction Studios](https://github.com/cds-tech)
